### Description

Discogs has a very simple and fast method for downloading your data. You have to download each data type as a separate CSV file, but Discogs exports the CSV files very fast. In testing, an account was used that had a collection of around 100 items and the collection archive was created in about 10 seconds.

### Steps

1. Login to Discogs from a desktop or laptop
1. On the home page, click on the "Export" tab
1. For each type of data you'd like to export, check that data type and click "Request Data Export"

1. Check back in this tab periodically for the status to change from "Processing" to "Download". Discogs will also send an email when the export file is ready.
1. Then just hit the download button
