### Description

Twitter's export option provides a zip file containing machine-readable Javascript files. This is convenient if the end user would like to push this data into their own custom datastore, but is not very human-readable. 

### Steps

1. Login to Twitter in a browser on a desktop or laptop
1. Go to your settings page [here](https://twitter.com/settings/account)
1. On the left sidebar, click "Your Twitter data"
1. Scroll all the way to the bottom of this page and click the "Request data" button
