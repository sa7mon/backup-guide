So you've gone through the guides on this site and downloaded your data from all the sites you use. Good job! Now we have to make sure your single point of failure (your computer) is also protected against data loss.

The good news is that backing up your local data is fairly painless and inexpensive - hard drive space is cheap and getting cheaper every day. As of writing, 1TB external hard drives can be bought for $50. 

The recommended strategy for backing your data up is known as the "3-2-1" strategy. [This post](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/) does a great job of explaining how this strategy works, so that information will not be duplicated here.

## Recommendations

For external hard drives, just find a highly rated drive listed on Amazon or your local retailer made by a reputable manufacturer such as Western Digital, Seagate, or Toshiba. 

For cloud backup solutions, Backblaze is recommended as the best and easiest to use. For $5/month, you can have unlimited amounts of data backed up offsite that will run with little-to-no user interaction after setup.
